Udacity EG FWD project of EDF (Earliest Deadline First ) is a scheduling algorithm that transforms a dynamic priority-based preemptive scheduling system.

So the priority of a task is depending on the deadline of the task so it is dynamic scheduling, and the processing of any task can be interrupted by a request for any higher priority task.
